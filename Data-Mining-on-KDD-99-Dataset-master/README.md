# Data-Mining-on-KDD-99-Dataset
*****README FILE*****

PREREQUISITES

IDE:-Jupyter Notebooks and Pycharm
LANGUAGE:-Python

Run:-
Libraries:-
pandas
numpy 
matplotlib
math

Algorithms and respective IDE to run on:-

Jupyter Notebooks:-Naivebayes
Pycharm:-knn,decision tree,random forest


Required files:-

1.Dataset file "subsetkdd99_proc.csv" which is a subset from 10%filtered kdd'99 dataset having 1065 records.
This file is already filtered so we do not need to use "preprocessing.ipynb(jupyter file)" for preprocessing.
We can use this file for testing since it has less records.

2.Dataset file "smalldataset_proc.csv" having only 46 records.
If you wish to run the algorithms real quick.

3.Actual KDD'99 DATASET preprocessed file is "kddcup99_proc.csv" but running this file would take alot of time on the algorithms.

RUN FILE:-

1. Put "algorithm.ipynb" or "algorithm.py" and both the required files in the root folder or specify the path of the file in the code.
2. Run "algorithm.ipynb" 

EXAMPLE:-
JUPYTER EXAMPLE
If you wish to run Naive Bayes then:-
1.Check the name of the file in the 2nd cell.
2.Run naivebayes.ipynb in jupyter.

PYCHARM EXAMPLE
If you wish to run KNN then:-
1. Change the path of the file to your local path and put file "KNN.py" and data set("subsetkdd99_proc.csv") on the local path.
2. Run KNN.py
